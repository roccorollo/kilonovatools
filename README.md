# kilonovatools
tools useful for conversions from spectra to photometry, luminosity to fluxes and viceversa

### andNEDredshift.py
adjusted from NED: used to compute distANCE LUMINOSITIES IN Mpc

### lumflux.pyd
several functions to ttransform between luminosity, flux desities and magnitudes

### ift.py  
used to integrate filter over model

### data2mod.py  
used to trasfrom data to model (e.g. an observed spectra in flux density to luminosity )

### dosimphot.py  
used to simulate photmetry from spectral models

### dospectophot.py
tool to convolve spectral data with filters in obs frame

### folder  trasm
transmission of sevral filters from hyperz ad svo (microns)
